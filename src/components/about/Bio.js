      <p className="mb-3 text-sm leading-tight text-light">I am a full-stack web developer in training, currently studying at the Coder Academy bootcamp in Brisbane, Australia.</p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-sm leading-tight text-light">For the past four years, I worked as a finance lawyer in a commercial law firm. Coding has been a long-time hobby and passion of mine, and this year I made the decision to turn it into a career.</p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-sm leading-tight text-light">I look forward to applying the analytical and problem-solving skills developed in my former career in the more creative and (to me) more exciting field of software development.</p>
      <p className="text-sm leading-tight text-light">When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning (human) languages - I speak Mandarin, Japanese and Korean to varying degrees of fluency. I also love to travel, and can't wait to get back to it in a post-COVID world.</p>
